                Here is the process I used to plan for my trip. Hopefully it can help when you plan yours!<h3>1) Created a Calendar (in Google Calendar)</h3>
                <p>
                    I searched for major festivals, holidays, events, going on during my trip (July-August) and put them on a calendar. Anything that sounded remotely interesting went on there. Online guidebooks, tourism sites, and whatsonwhen.com were great resources.
                </p>
                <h3>2) Created a Map (in Google Maps)</h3>
                <p>
                    Next, I built a map of places I wanted to visit. I began with cities, then added specific landmarks, then searched online guidebooks and the advice of others who had traveled in Europe to add additional markers.
                </p>
                <h3>3) Reconciled the two</h3>
                <p>
                    I looked at the calendar to determine which events I really wanted to go to and what made sense travel-wise -- If one event was going on in London one day, and the next was an event in Italy, I immediately canceled one out. For tough choices, I used the map I built to guide my decision.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The main beacons of structure ended up being national days and big festivals. These had a very good flow of time (about a week apart from each other) and space (usually neighboring countries).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then, I updated my calendar with the solidified countries and dates. I planned 3 day stays in most places which resulted in many gaps in between places. To fill in the gaps, I went back to my map and looked at neighboring places where I'd want to visit. I picked places that were in between two places that I had in my calendar so that it would be easier to travel through. At times it made sense to make big leaps by plane (ex. Brussels to Stockholm), to save time.
                </p>
                <h3>4) Handled Exceptions</h3>
                <p>
                    I now had a pretty solid plan that could now be broken at will. I wanted to visit a friend in Ukraine during my trip, so I worked with her to figure out when the best time for me to visit would be. I took some things out of my schedule and put that trip in it's place. Most exceptions to the original plan were due to visiting people that I didn't know were in Europe (like distant family in Germany).
                </p>
                <h3>5) Travel Detail Tweaks</h3>
                <p>
                    I did actual travel planning (how to get from place A to B) early on (step 2-3). I should have waited. As long as you know where you're coming from and where you're going, you'll easily find a way -- you don't have to plan too early ahead for that in Europe. It's a waste of time when you have to make changes. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I created another map (private) and started looking at train tables (Rail Europe was great) and flight schedules (see <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_low-cost_airlines">this Wikipedia article</a>) to work out the travel details. I drew lines in the map connecting the train stations and annotated them with one or two train times. This is time consuming, but worth it. You familiarize yourself with the soroundings and feel comfortable knowing you know where to go. I also added the same data to my calendar as a back-up and a quicker way of looking at it. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once I felt comfortable with my plan I bought the plane tickets and my 2-month train pass. I copied all my confirmation/booking numbers in both the calendar and the map.
                </p>
                <h3>6) Everything Else In No Particular Order</h3>
                <h4>Emergency Planning</h4>
                <p>
                    This is the boring part. I created an spreadsheet (using Google Docs), and added the following columns: Country, Phone Code, US Embassy Phone #, Youth Hostel Association Phone #, Mastercard Emergency Line, and UTC code (for time difference). I filled it out for every country I'll  visit. In another sheet I added all the important numbers I could think of including contacts in Turkey, the US, and abroad, travel insurance phone numbers, airline phone numbers, etc... 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I copied my important documents and put them in both my backpack, my day pack, and at home. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I got a replacement debit card in case one got damaged abroad. I put my most important documents (passport, trainpass, and extra card) in a money belt to keep with me at all times.
                </p>
                <h4>Languages</h4>
                <p>
                    I printed out some common phrases in all languages for the countries I'd be visiting. I put the upcoming country in my Day Pack, all others in my Backpack. I also got iPhone applications that could translate in those languages.
                </p>
                <h4>Computer Setup</h4>
                <p>
                    I'm bringing my girlfriend Jessa's small netbook for the trip, along with my iPhone. I use Google Chrome as a browser, which syncs up bookmarks and settings between browsers and my Google account. I set-up a plethora of bookmarks and organized them -- from city guides to direct links to my online documents/calendar/maps to potential couchsurfing candidates. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I also installed and connected Picasa on the netbook and set it up to sync photos automatically to my Google account whenever I dumped my memory card in it. I created folders to have things organized (Pictures and Documents) and created offline copies of my documents on the computer.
                </p>
                <h4>Packing</h4>
                <p>
                    I created an online spreadsheet with "Have" and "Buy" as sheets. I started this early on and added as I remembered things. The columns I used were "Item", "To Go In/On", "Current Location", and "Notes". I put _everything_ I'd bring in there. Including what I would be wearing on the day of the trip (ex. item "Green Shirt", to go on "Body", currently in "Closet"). This helped me identify missing things, take out redundant things, and organize my stuff much better than physically gathering them. It also made a great shopping list where I could access the "To Buy" list through my iPhone. I read plenty of packing tips online as to what to bring and not bring, just basic Google searches. I bought some very expensive clothes/underwear that's super quick drying so I could wash them in a sink and they'd be dried in a few hours.
                </p>
                <h4>Gifts/Postcards</h4>
                <p>
                    I created an online spreadsheet to keep track of and remember who I plan to get gifts for or send postcards to along with their addresses. I wrote down possible ideas before hand so I could save myself precious time to get started.
                </p>
                <h4>Blog/Site</h4>
                <p>
                    I created a blog (using <a href="http://www.tumblr.com/">Tumblr</a>) and a custom webpage for my trip. I made simple URL that I could share with people who were interested in my trip. I included a map of where I'd be and contact info in case anyone had advice to give.
                </p>
                <h4>CouchSurfing</h4>
                <p>
                    Go join <a href="http://www.couchsurfing.com/">CouchSurfing.com</a>! It's an awesome community and resource. I couldn't think of a better way to travel than staying with people who live in the places I'm visiting. However, I've also made sure I have more than enough money to do my entire trip through hostels (and joined Hosteling International) as a back-up.
                </p>
                <h4>Ideas/Advice</h4>
                <p>
                    I asked everyone I possibly knew for advice and got advice and help from people I wouldn't have expected. So, it never hurts to ask.
                </p>
                <h4>Google</h4>
                <p>
                    I used Google services in nearly every stage of my planning. This way, I can access it from any computer (even if my iPhone and netbook dissappear) and they interconnect very well (I began syncing my iPhone contacts from my GMail account after my first iPhone was stolen and I lost everything). I printed out the absolute essentials in case something goes horribly wrong, but if Google ever goes down long enough to matter, I figured there are probably bigger issues going on in the world.
                </p>
                <h4>Others</h4>
                <p>
                    I bought a small bike lock to lock up my bags while on the train. Most of my fancy quick-dry clothes are made by North Face, ExOfficio, Patagonia, I found good prices at <a href="http://www.backcountry.com/">backcountry.com</a>. I shopped at REI quite a bit too (that's also where my backpack is from). I bought great socks for cheap from Marshall's.
