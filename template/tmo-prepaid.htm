		I led the development and architecture of T-Mobile's prepaid phone website, 
		<a href="http://prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com/">prepaid-phones.t-mobile.com</a>. 
		In addition to the consumer-facing website, we also 
		developed a CMS to manage content, phones, accessories, and offers, 
		and synchronize with various feeds from T-Mobile's services.
