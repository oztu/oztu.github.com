    	<a href="http://ozan.io/collage">Collage.js</a>: Live, dynamic, and interactive collages.
    </p>
    <p>
		Collage.js is a framework which brings together many public APIs, 
		along a method of presenting media within a limitless two-dimesional 
		space to create memorable experiences.

    	I wrote the core of Collage.js in February 2013 for my girlfriend's birthday present. 
    	I liked where the codebase was going, so I polished it up,
    	documented it, and released it in March 2013 along with <a href="#/samelove.us">samelove.us</a>.
