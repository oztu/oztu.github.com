    	<a href="http://samelove.us">Same Love</a>: A live &amp; dynamic collage.
    </p>
    <p>
		LGBT rights is one of the few issues where I see the solution as clear-cut: 
		equality. I've been thinking about how I can show my support for quite some 
		time and decided to contribute by doing what I'm already good at: coding 
		late into the night.

    	This HTML5 app pulls live data from Twitter, Flickr, Facebook, New York Times, 
    	Google News, Reddit, and  Youtube to create an infinite collage
    	synchronized to a music video with the same name by Macklemore. 
    	I built this in March of 2013 using Collage.js, a framework I had originally created 
    	for my girlfriend's birthday present.

    <p> Unfortunately, due to the amount of animations and the technologies utilized, 
    	it requires Google Chrome and a fast computer with a dedicated video card to run.
    	It also takes damn near forever to load, due to the amount of content in needs 
    	to gather from across the internet.
    </p>

        View the collage at <a href="http://samelove.us">samelove.us</a> and see the code on
