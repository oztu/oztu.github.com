    	<a href="http://ozan.io/p">P</a> is for peer-to-peer networking with browsers.
    </p>
    <p>
		P is a small JavaScript library for creating peer-to-peer applications in browsers.
        It exposes a very simple API that allows for complex network patterns to be quickly
        established. P is based on and up-and-coming technology (<a href="http://www.webrtc.org/">WebRTC</a>), 
        which is designed to allow for real-time communcation between browsers. 
    </p>
    <p>
        <a href="http://peerjs.com/">PeerJS</a> is another library which deals
        with the same underlying technology. P differentiates itself by enabling any peer to 
        connect any peers which are connected to it. This allows for transitive connections
        and makes certain network topologies, such mesh networks, easy to establish.
