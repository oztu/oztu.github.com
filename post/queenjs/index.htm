    	<a href="http://queenjs.com">Queen</a>, a platform for distributed computing
        using browsers as computation nodes.
    </p>
    <p>
		Queen is a server which enables 
		distributed code execution on browsers. It establishes socketed 
		communication between browsers and other applications or scripts. 
		You can think of the Queen Server as a pool of browsers which you 
		can execute code on.

    	This is the first open source project I've released, it became one of the
        top trending project on the day of release on GitHub. I worked on Queen throughout
    	the Fall of 2012. I was initially interested in distributed testing
    	with a shared browser pool, something we needed at Turn. As I worked on
    	the project, it made sense to split it into an abstract platform for distributed 
        execution (Queen), and a layer on top for the testing-specific use-case (Thrill).
