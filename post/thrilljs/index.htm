    	<a href="http://thrilljs.com">Thrill</a>: Test runner for web app development teams.
    </p>
    <p>
		Thrill runs web application tests in browsers. 
		It provides a central server which can run tests in parallel across many browsers 
		and systems. It's capable of running QUnit, Jasmine, Mocha, and YUI tests out-of-the-box
		with no configuration or additional files in your project.
    </p>
    <p>
    	I developed Thrill along with Queen throughout the Fall of 2012 to reduce the burden
    	of cross-browser testing that my team was facing at Turn. At the time, most test runners 
    	required each developer to have their own instance 
    	of browsers, and the few that were centralized were slow. 
    </p>
    <p>	Queen and Thrill enable us
    	to have a central pool of browsers which developers can requests their tests to be run on,
    	often finishing within one or two seconds (for ~200 tests). We've been using Thrill and Queen at 
    	since the beginning of 2013 and they've been working out great.
