    	<a href="http://www.turn.com/solutions/audiences/capture">Flextag</a>: Point-and-click website tagging.
    </p>
    <p>
		Flextag is a data collection solution provided by Turn. I've architected and developed
		a novel web application which enables point-and-click data collection from websites for clients 
		without the need for technical know-how or help from IT. I'm listed as one of the 
		inventors for the patent filed for the tool. 
	</p>
	<p>I worked on this project at <a href="http://www.turn.com/">Turn</a> in Fall of 2012.</p>
